# K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm in which the entire training dataset is stored and when a prediction is required, the k-most similar records to a new record from the training dataset are then located. From these neighbors, a summarized prediction is made. Once the neighbors are discovered, the summary pre- diction can be made by returning the most common outcome or taking the average. The KNN can be used for classification or regression problems.In this chapter, it summarizes the method in which KNN classifier was build using MATLAB using the MNIST digits dataset.
